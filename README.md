# Single-cell multimodal modeling with deep parametric inference
The proliferation of single-cell multimodal sequencing technologies has enabled us to understand cellular heterogeneity with multiple views, providing novel and actionable biological insights into the disease-driving mechanisms. Here, we propose the deep parametric inference (DPI) model, an end-to-end framework for single-cell multimodal data analysis. At the heart of DPI is the multimodal parameter space, where the parameters from each modal are inferred by neural networks. 
## The dpi framework works with scanpy and supports the following single-cell multimodal analyses
* Multimodal data integration
* Multimodal data noise reduction
* Cell clustering and visualization
* Reference and query cell types
* Cell state vector field visualization
## Pip install
```python
pip install dpi-sc
```
